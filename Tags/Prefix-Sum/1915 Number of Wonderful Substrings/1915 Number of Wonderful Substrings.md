```go

		int running=0;

            running ^= 1 << (w-'a');
			
			// Add counts of substrings with at most character `c` of odd counts.
			// As seen in observation we need count of prefix parities with opposite parity of character we are considering for odd count.
			// The rest remains same as we want even count for all other characters.
			// Here we are checking all possible characters, however it can be obtimized to check characters only present in the input word.

			// As seen in observation we need count of prefix parities with same parities as current running parity.
